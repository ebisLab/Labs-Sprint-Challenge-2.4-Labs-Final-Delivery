# May 1, 2020 - Final Delivery
# Labs-Sprint-Challenge-2.4-Labs-Final-Delivery

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over your labs experience and apply them by providing answers to questions related to the Final Delivery of your Labs product.

ðŸ’¡This is your final presentation to be delivered for Lambda Labs and the Journal Entries you've written up to this point should drive the content for your 2 min slide-deck video presentation.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Journal Entry.**

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Journal Entry. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in team planning and product vision.

We have allocated time on your schedule to ensure that you get this done at the end of each sprint.

- For Full Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before 11am PST every Friday.
- For Part Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before the end of your B-Week Thursday class period.

## Introduction

Throughout Labs, you have learned what it takes to be an active contributor to a product team. You have helped a project (whether it be greenfield or build-on) go from an idea (Product Vision) to a set of features that solve a problem (Release Canvases) to a list of items that need to be completed in order to solve those problems (User Stories/Trello) cards. Along the way, you have **crafted a story** that outlines your progress throughout your Labs journey by responding to prompts in *journal entry* format. 

Now we'd like for you to put together a final presentation of your story. The following prompts will help you create an outline for your presentation content.

After completing the prompts, you may choose to also deliver a presentation of your Lambda Labs story in the form of a slide-deck video presentation.

### Prompt 1

**Required**

- Describe in detail the favorite feature that you built, designed or delivered as a member of your project team. **Please include links to a Figma file, pull-requests or link to a file in a repository that outlines the work you did on this feature.

My favorite part of the project was when we implemented the table rows and columns layout to render our data from the backend. I guess it's because I'm so visual that I got excited at the thought of how everything we built in prisma and apollo came to merge beautifully with our new graph ql skill in the front end. And because of that we got ambitious, and proceeded to start release canvas 3, which was the data visualization part.

- Describe the biggest hurdle you overcame technically or from a design perspective. **Be specific in what the problem was and how you overcame it.**

We had to figured out how ANTD design and React Hook Form can coexist, so we made the choice to do away with react hook forms and go the regular route that we were used to when we were in the web unit. It actually worked better for us since we were spending alot of time debugging code that one package library cancelled out the other. 

- Describe in detail the biggest 'inter-personal' conflict you overcame as a member of your project team. **Be specific but please don't mention any team members by name.**

When I came onto this project I was struggling to see how my skills would fit in. I've always been used to being the lone wolf to various projects, even during build weeks, I was either one of two people in a team that specialized in that team at that time, front end, backend. But seeing that there were so many of us that had fullstack experience at this point, it was hard to find where I could contribute daily since everyone have been fast in snatching up those tasks. When looking at our daily tasks on Trello, we realized that every task dependended on other tasks chosen by the other team members, so we had to rely on alot of peer programming to make sure we werent over stepping on each other's work. Also, I struggled communicating with my team when they would refactor my portion of the operations they assigned me to do. I worked slowly at my own pace, others work at a faster pace, and when the were done, they would jump on my part of the file and work on it, refactoring things, and not letting me know that they were doing it, so it got a bit chaotic for a bit. Doing more zoom calls to clarify what everybody was doing eased the tensions and made it easier for us to trust each other to allow us to not interfere on other people's work. 

### Slide Deck

**Optional**

- Your slide-deck presentation should include the following:
    - 1 slide on the problem tried your team set out to solve.
    - 1 slide on the user research that went into your product vision.
    - 1 slide on breaking down into releases `Release Canvases`
    - 1 slide on favorite feature. Include screenshots as necessary.
    - 1 slide on how they tested that feature. Tell us how you made sure that the feature worked correctly and how you know it solves the problem you set out to solve.
    - 1 slide of reflection as to what they did differently. This is to be a short retrospective of what you learned during your labs experience
